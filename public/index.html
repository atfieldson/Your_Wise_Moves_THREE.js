    <h1>Sphere Animation</h1>
    <p>This is an animation I created while during the group project portion of my time at Prime Digital Academy.  It sat in the backgroung
        of a game application that had a series of rounds.  Each round, this background would shift to reflect the round that was being played.
    </p>
    <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
        <p>
            Three.js
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML/CSS
        </p>
        <p>
            React.JS (in the application itself, not in this example)
        </p>
    <h2>
        Challenges
    </h2>
    <p>
        I had to use my full knowledge of Three.JS to use the clients original artwork as the material 
        (what is wrapped around the geometry, or shape that you see)
    </p>
    <p>
        Getting the spheres to move to the front of the rendering in a straight line is easy, getting it to move 
        along a bezier curve was much more difficult!
    </p>
    <p>
        Easing the movement path of the spheres was difficult.  Easing makes the animation look more natural, notice how the spheres
        start their movement slowly, get faster, and then slow down again.
